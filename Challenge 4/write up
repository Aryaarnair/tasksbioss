I have done this fully with help of GPT but i knew how the connections. But code i have done is with the help of GPT but the codes it provided were not working then i kind of understood how and where it went wrong and i made a different code with which the challenge now works fine,
I don't have any kind of exposure to any of these tasks but reffering GPT was the only way I could do all these tasks.But reffering GPT alone didn't help much i refferd a lot of videos and all.
