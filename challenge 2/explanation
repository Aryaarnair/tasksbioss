I tried to simulate the given code but it didn't work properly but then i changed the code to simple arduino code then i got the output.Analysing the given code pin 4 is the input and pin 5 is the out put but when i tinkered this with the given code it didn't work I don't know why. But then I changed the code then i got to do the challenge.
challlenge was to simulate the given code which i couldn't do , but it did work when i gave the pins 12 and 13, so I don't think I did this task right.
