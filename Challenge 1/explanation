I have studied about the logic gates, full adder , half adder and about MUX but i don't know how to tinker this with 8x1 MUX since there is no 8x1 MUX on tinkercad as well as Wokwi
And i somehow got to know that you can maje 8x1 MUX by 8 2x1 MUX but don't know how so i have tinker 3 bit full adder circuit as well as one 2x1 MUX. 
I'm aware that i haven't completed this task but this is all I could do
 you need 6 + 2 = 8 2x1 multiplexers to construct an 8x1 multiplexer using 2x1 multiplexers.
